## 5. Stock Deduction on Sales ✅

### Implementation Details

#### Backend Stock Management (`backend/src/Models/Stock.php`)
- `updateStock()` method (lines 41-57)
- Uses `quantity = quantity + ?` which allows negative values for deduction
- Automatically creates stock record if it doesn't exist
- Updates existing stock records

#### Sales Invoice Flow
1. **Validation** (InvoiceController.php, lines 162-172):
   - Checks van stock availability before creating invoice
   - Throws exception if insufficient stock
   
2. **Stock Deduction** (line 224):
   ```php
   $this->stockModel->updateStock($item['product_id'], 'van', $data['van_id'], -$item['quantity']);
   ```
   - Passes negative quantity to subtract from van stock
   - Executed within database transaction for safety

3. **Movement Recording** (lines 227-238):
   - Records stock movement from van to customer
   - Tracks movement type as 'sale'
   - Links to invoice for audit trail

#### Purchase Invoice Flow
1. **Stock Addition** (InvoiceController.php, line 115):
   ```php
   $this->stockModel->updateStock($item['product_id'], 'warehouse', 0, $item['quantity']);
   ```
   - Adds purchased items to warehouse stock
   
2. **Movement Recording** (lines 118-129):
   - Records stock movement from supplier to warehouse
   - Tracks movement type as 'purchase'
