# Separate Invoice Tables Implementation

## âœ… COMPLETED

The system has been successfully updated to use separate tables for purchase and sales invoices.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. New Models Created

#### `backend/src/Models/PurchaseInvoice.php`
- Manages `purchase_invoices` table
- Methods:
  - `getInvoicesWithDetails()` - List purchase invoices with supplier info
  - `getInvoiceWithItems()` - Get single invoice with items
  - `generateInvoiceNumber()` - Format: `PUR-YYYYMMDD-001`
  - `updatePaidAmount()` - Update payment status

#### `backend/src/Models/SalesInvoice.php`
- Manages `sales_invoices` table
- Methods:
  - `getInvoicesWithDetails()` - List sales invoices with customer/van info
  - `getInvoiceWithItems()` - Get single invoice with items
  - `generateInvoiceNumber()` - Format: `SAL-YYYYMMDD-001`
  - `updatePaidAmount()` - Update payment status

### 2. Controller Updates

#### `backend/src/Controllers/InvoiceController.php`

**Properties Changed:**
```php
// OLD
private $invoiceModel;

// NEW
private $purchaseInvoiceModel;
private $salesInvoiceModel;
```

**Methods Updated:**

**`index()`** - List invoices
- Now checks `invoice_type` parameter
- Routes to correct model based on type
- Returns purchase OR sales invoices

**`show($id)`** - Get single invoice
- Checks `invoice_type` parameter
- Routes to correct model
- Returns invoice with items

**`createPurchase($user)`** - Create purchase invoice
- Uses `purchase_invoices` table
- Inserts into `purchase_invoice_items` table
- Generates `PUR-` invoice numbers
- Adds stock to warehouse
- Records negative payment (expense)

**`createSales($user)`** - Create sales invoice
- Uses `sales_invoices` table
- Inserts into `sales_invoice_items` table
- Generates `SAL-` invoice numbers
- Reduces van stock
- Records positive payment (income)

## Database Tables

### Purchase Invoices
```
purchase_invoices
â”œâ”€â”€ id
â”œâ”€â”€ invoice_number (PUR-YYYYMMDD-XXX)
â”œâ”€â”€ supplier_id (references customers table)
â”œâ”€â”€ subtotal
â”œâ”€â”€ tax_amount
â”œâ”€â”€ discount_amount
â”œâ”€â”€ total_amount
â”œâ”€â”€ paid_amount
â”œâ”€â”€ payment_status
â”œâ”€â”€ notes
â”œâ”€â”€ created_by
â”œâ”€â”€ created_at
â””â”€â”€ updated_at

purchase_invoice_items
â”œâ”€â”€ id
â”œâ”€â”€ invoice_id (references purchase_invoices)
â”œâ”€â”€ product_id
â”œâ”€â”€ quantity
â”œâ”€â”€ unit_price
â”œâ”€â”€ discount_percent
â”œâ”€â”€ tax_percent
â””â”€â”€ total
```

### Sales Invoices
```
sales_invoices
â”œâ”€â”€ id
â”œâ”€â”€ invoice_number (SAL-YYYYMMDD-XXX)
â”œâ”€â”€ customer_id
â”œâ”€â”€ van_id
â”œâ”€â”€ subtotal
â”œâ”€â”€ tax_amount
â”œâ”€â”€ discount_amount
â”œâ”€â”€ total_amount
â”œâ”€â”€ paid_amount
â”œâ”€â”€ payment_status
â”œâ”€â”€ notes
â”œâ”€â”€ created_by
â”œâ”€â”€ created_at
â””â”€â”€ updated_at

sales_invoice_items
â”œâ”€â”€ id
â”œâ”€â”€ invoice_id (references sales_invoices)
â”œâ”€â”€ product_id
â”œâ”€â”€ quantity
â”œâ”€â”€ unit_price
â”œâ”€â”€ discount_percent
â”œâ”€â”€ tax_percent
â””â”€â”€ total
```

## API Behavior

### Get Invoices
```
GET /api/invoices?invoice_type=purchase
GET /api/invoices?invoice_type=sales
```
- Returns invoices from respective table
- Includes related data (supplier/customer/van)

### Get Single Invoice
```
GET /api/invoices/123?invoice_type=purchase
GET /api/invoices/456?invoice_type=sales
```
- Fetches from correct table based on type
- Returns invoice with items

### Create Purchase Invoice
```
POST /api/invoices/purchase
```
- Creates record in `purchase_invoices`
- Creates items in `purchase_invoice_items`
- **Adds** stock to warehouse
- Records **negative** payment

### Create Sales Invoice
```
POST /api/invoices/sales
```
- Creates record in `sales_invoices`
- Creates items in `sales_invoice_items`
- **Reduces** van stock
- Records **positive** payment

## Frontend Compatibility

### No Changes Required!
The frontend code continues to work because:

1. **API endpoints unchanged** - Still `/api/invoices`
2. **invoice_type parameter** - Frontend already sends this
3. **Response format** - Models add `invoice_type` field for compatibility
4. **POS system** - Works with sales invoices automatically

### How It Works:
```javascript
// Frontend sends
invoiceApi.getAll({ invoice_type: 'purchase' })

// Backend routes to
$this->purchaseInvoiceModel->getInvoicesWithDetails($filters)

// Returns data with
invoice['invoice_type'] = 'purchase' // Added for compatibility
```

---

## Invoice Number Formats

### Purchase Invoices
- Format: `PUR-YYYYMMDD-XXX`
- Example: `PUR-20250101-001`
- Sequential per day

### Sales Invoices
- Format: `SAL-YYYYMMDD-XXX`
- Example: `SAL-20250101-001`
- Sequential per day

### Benefits:
- âœ… Easy to identify invoice type at a glance
- âœ… Separate numbering sequences
- âœ… Date-based organization
- âœ… Professional appearance

---

## Stock Movement

### Purchase Invoice
```
Supplier â†’ Warehouse
Stock: +quantity (ADD)
Payment: -amount (EXPENSE)
```

### Sales Invoice
```
Van â†’ Customer
Stock: -quantity (SUBTRACT)
Payment: +amount (INCOME)
```

---

## Payment Recording

### Purchase Invoice Payment
```php
'amount' => -$data['paid_amount']  // Negative
'invoice_type' => 'purchase'
```
- Shown in **RED** on Payments page
- Represents money going OUT

### Sales Invoice Payment
```php
'amount' => $data['paid_amount']  // Positive
'invoice_type' => 'sales'
```
- Shown in **GREEN** on Payments page
- Represents money coming IN

## Benefits of Separate Tables

### 1. Data Organization
âœ… Clear separation of purchase vs sales
âœ… Different fields for each type (supplier vs van)
âœ… Easier to query specific invoice types

### 2. Performance
âœ… Smaller tables = faster queries
âœ… Separate indexes for each type
âœ… Better query optimization

### 3. Maintenance
âœ… Easier to modify purchase logic without affecting sales
âœ… Clear code structure
âœ… Reduced complexity in queries

### 4. Reporting
âœ… Easy to generate purchase-only reports
âœ… Easy to generate sales-only reports
âœ… Clear financial separation

### 5. Future Enhancements
âœ… Can add purchase-specific fields
âœ… Can add sales-specific fields
âœ… Different validation rules per type
